# KU POLLS

[![Django CI](https://github.com/OmegaOoh/ku-polls/actions/workflows/django.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/OmegaOoh/ku-polls/actions/workflows/django.yml)

Polls web application powered by Django based on [Django Tutorial](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.1/intro/) used to conduct polls or surveys in the KU community
with a simple web interface for creating polls with opening and closing for each poll or survey question,
responding to opened polls and seeing the results of a poll even if the poll is closed.

This app was created as part of the [Individual Software Process](
https://cpske.github.io/ISP) course at [Kasetsart University](https://www.ku.ac.th).
